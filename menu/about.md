Hi there! <br> 
We pursue research that offers academic foundations for creating a livable, workable, and inclusive community for everyone. By leveraging urban data science (machine learning, AI) and experimental research design, we address challenges cities face in the intersecting areas of land use, transportation, and the emergence of smart technology. We believe that, through my research, planners can implement evidence-based policy interventions that drive meaningful change, making cities livable, workable, and inclusive for everyone. 

For more information, please feel free to reach out through any available channels, or visit office at 28-413, Incheon National University.
