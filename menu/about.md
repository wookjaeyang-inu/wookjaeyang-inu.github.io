Hi there! <br> 
We pursue research that offers academic foundations for creating a livable, workable, and inclusive community for everyone. By leveraging urban data science (machine learning, AI) and experimental research design, we address challenges cities face in the intersecting areas of land use, transportation, and smart technology. We believe that, through our research, planners can implement evidence-based policy interventions that drive meaningful change in our society while achieving smart growth.
